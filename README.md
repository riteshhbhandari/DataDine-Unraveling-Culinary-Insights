# Restaurant Review Database Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze restaurant reviews using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The main focus of the project is to demonstrate how to connect Python to a SQL database using a SQL connector. By leveraging these libraries and database connectivity, we aim to gain insights into restaurant reviews and extract valuable information for decision-making processes.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SQL Database
- SQL Connector sqlite3

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Directory containing dataset files.
- **scripts/**: Directory containing Python scripts for data analysis and database connectivity.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the project.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-review-database.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change directory to the project folder.

    ```bash
    cd restaurant-review-database
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that Python and the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed. If not, install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```

4. **Set Up Database**: Ensure that you have a SQL database set up with the necessary tables and data. Update the database connection details in the Python scripts accordingly.

5. **Run the Scripts**: Execute the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory to perform data analysis and connect to the SQL database.

    ```bash
    python scripts/analyze_reviews.py
    ```

6. **View Results**: Explore the results of the analysis generated by the Python scripts. Visualizations may be saved as images or displayed in the console.
